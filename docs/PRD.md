# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Liebe - Custom Home Assistant Dashboard

## Executive Summary

Liebe is an open-source dashboard for Home Assistant that provides a modern, customizable interface with native integration. The project focuses on performance, ease of use, and extensibility while maintaining full compatibility with Home Assistant's ecosystem.

## Project Goals

1. **Native Integration**: Seamless integration with Home Assistant as a custom panel
2. **Modern Stack**: Leverage TanStack Start for optimal performance and developer experience
3. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for dashboard customization
4. **Real-time Updates**: Instant reflection of entity state changes
5. **Extensible**: Architecture that allows for future feature additions

## Technical Architecture

### Integration Method
- Custom Panel integration
- Direct access to Home Assistant's `hass` object
- No separate authentication required
- Accessible via Home Assistant sidebar

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: TanStack Start with React (SPA Mode)
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: TanStack Store
- **Build Tool**: Vite (via TanStack Start)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS with Radix UI defaults

### Development Environment
- Home Assistant instance: To be provided when needed
- Local development with hot reload
- GitHub Projects for task management

## MVP Feature Set

The MVP is organized into 6 epics, each representing a major feature area. Detailed tasks and requirements for each epic are tracked in GitHub Projects.

### Epic 1: Project Foundation
Establish the basic project structure and development environment with TanStack Start, TypeScript, and Home Assistant integration.

### Epic 2: Core Dashboard Infrastructure
Build the fundamental dashboard system with view management, state handling, and configuration persistence.

### Epic 3: Entity Management
Develop the system for displaying and controlling Home Assistant entities with real-time updates.

### Epic 4: Dashboard Editor
Enable users to customize their dashboards through an intuitive interface without writing code.

### Epic 5: UI Components and Theming
Create the essential UI components using Radix UI and implement basic theming support.

### Epic 6: Advanced Entity Controls
Extend entity support beyond basic switches to include lights, climate, sensors, and other Home Assistant entity types.

## Post-MVP Features

### Phase 2 Enhancements
- Weather widget integration
- Media player controls
- Camera stream support
- Graph/chart visualizations
- Conditional visibility rules

### Phase 3 Advanced Features
- Picture elements support
- Custom card system
- Advanced templating
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Multi-language support

## Design Goals

1. **Performance**: Fast loading and responsive interactions
2. **Accessibility**: Usable by everyone, regardless of abilities
3. **Simplicity**: Intuitive interface that doesn't require documentation
4. **Reliability**: Stable operation with graceful error handling
5. **Compatibility**: Support for recent Home Assistant versions

## UI/UX Principles

Successful open source projects share common qualities that Liebe should embrace:

- **Immediate Usability**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults (leveraging Radix UI's built-in accessibility and behavior)
- **Progressive Complexity**: Advanced features discoverable but not overwhelming
- **Dark Mode First**: Respects system preferences, with light mode as an option
- **Responsive Design**: Functions well on all screen sizes
- **Clear Error States**: Helpful messages that guide users to solutions
- **Keyboard Friendly**: Full functionality without requiring a mouse
- **Data Portability**: Easy backup and restore of configurations

## Constraints and Considerations

1. **Browser Support**: Modern browsers only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. **Mobile**: Responsive design but mobile-first optimization in Phase 2
3. **Security**: Inherits Home Assistant's security model
4. **Configuration**: YAML-based configuration for consistency with HA
5. **Localization**: English-only for MVP

## Development Process

1. **Version Control**: Git with semantic versioning
2. **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches with PR-based workflow
3. **Testing**: Unit tests for critical functionality
4. **Documentation**: Inline code documentation and user guide
5. **Issue Tracking**: GitHub Projects for all epics and tasks


## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Risk**: Home Assistant API changes
   - **Mitigation**: Pin to specific HA version for MVP
   
2. **Risk**: Performance with many entities
   - **Mitigation**: Implement virtualization early
   
3. **Risk**: Complex state management
   - **Mitigation**: Use proven patterns and TanStack Store

4. **Risk**: Browser compatibility issues
   - **Mitigation**: Test on major browsers regularly
