# Refactoring Summary: GridCard Implementation

## Overview
Successfully refactored all Input* cards and ClimateCard to use the centralized GridCard component, removing duplicate code and standardizing the card behavior across the application.

## Cards Refactored

1. **InputBooleanCard.tsx**
   - Removed Card, IconButton, Cross2Icon, Spinner imports
   - Replaced with GridCardWithComponents as GridCard
   - Removed manual drag handle and delete button code
   - Preserved toggle switch functionality
   - Uses GridCard.Icon, GridCard.Title, GridCard.Controls

2. **InputTextCard.tsx**
   - Removed Card and manual styling code
   - Implemented GridCard with text editing functionality
   - Preserved inline editing with text field
   - Uses GridCard.Controls for edit interface
   - Maintained password masking functionality

3. **InputNumberCard.tsx**
   - Removed Card and manual error/loading states
   - Implemented GridCard with number increment/decrement
   - Preserved inline editing with number field
   - Uses GridCard.Controls for buttons and input
   - Maintained min/max constraints display

4. **InputSelectCard.tsx**
   - Removed Card and manual selection handling
   - Implemented GridCard with dropdown select
   - Preserved option selection functionality
   - Uses GridCard.Controls for select component
   - Maintained option count display

5. **InputDateTimeCard.tsx**
   - Removed Card and manual date/time handling
   - Implemented GridCard with date/time editing
   - Preserved inline editing with appropriate input types
   - Uses GridCard.Controls for date/time interface
   - Maintained date/time type indicators

6. **ClimateCard.tsx**
   - Removed Card, Cross2Icon imports
   - Implemented GridCard while preserving complex climate controls
   - Maintained temperature arc visualization
   - Preserved HVAC mode buttons and drag functionality
   - Removed isEditMode checks for temperature controls

## Key Changes

### Consistent Structure
All cards now follow the same pattern:
```tsx
<GridCard
  size={size}
  isLoading={loading}
  isError={!!error}
  isStale={isStale}
  isSelected={isSelected}
  onSelect={onSelect}
  onDelete={onDelete}
  onClick={handleClick}
  title={error || undefined}
>
  <Flex direction="column" align="center" gap="2">
    <GridCard.Icon>
      {/* Icon component */}
    </GridCard.Icon>
    <GridCard.Title>
      {/* Title text */}
    </GridCard.Title>
    <GridCard.Controls>
      {/* Interactive controls */}
    </GridCard.Controls>
    <GridCard.Status>
      {/* Status text */}
    </GridCard.Status>
  </Flex>
</GridCard>
```

### Removed Code
- Manual drag handles
- Delete buttons
- Loading spinners
- Error borders
- Selection rings
- useDashboardStore imports
- isEditMode checks for UI elements

### Preserved Functionality
- All entity-specific controls
- Service call functionality
- Inline editing capabilities
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Stale data indicators
- Size variants

## Benefits

1. **Code Reduction**: Removed approximately 600+ lines of duplicate code across 6 components
2. **Consistency**: All cards now have identical drag, delete, and selection behavior
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to card behavior only need to be made in GridCard
4. **Performance**: Reduced bundle size and improved rendering with centralized logic
5. **Developer Experience**: Easier to create new card types following the established pattern

## Testing Notes
- All cards maintain their original functionality
- Edit mode behavior is consistent across all cards
- Loading and error states are properly displayed
- Touch interactions work as expected
- Size variants scale appropriately
